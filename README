*** Idea
Mating-Manager is intended to be a manager application for managing 
mating apinaries.
It should help the manager of an mating apinary to schedule the arrival and leave of
mating hives, the places where the mating hives will stay for mating, maybe 
the accounting of the mating bill, the count of the mating hives.
On some german mating yards on islands there are transport costs which should also 
can be managed.

The users of the page can see which bee race is placed for mating and which father line of 
the race is on period on the mating apinary. 
Additional informations can be provided like the ancestory or other caracteristics.

Users should also can login and register hives for a period for mating and the visitor should get an 
email 2 or 3 days before the pick-up date of the pick-up.

The application should be suitable for mating apinaries worldwide so it's from the beginning 
planned to have a simple way to translate the applications output.

Every mating apinary should have blog like newsfeed and a calendar.
